## About

It's a simple application that can find details about an address based on a given zipcode (a.k.a CEP in Brazil). The user also can trace a route in the map using througt Cepp. The API which this app uses to search the information about zipcodes works only with brazilian zipcodes.


This application uses the [Aviso Brasil] API (http://avisobrasil.com.br/correio-control/api-de-consulta-de-cep/) to get the information of a zipcode and the Google Geocoding Service througt the wrapper [SVGeocoder](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVGeocoder) to get the geolocalization.
