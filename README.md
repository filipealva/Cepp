## About

It's a simple application that can find details about an address based on a given zipcode (a.k.a CEP in Brazil). The user also can trace a route in the map using througt Cepp. The API which this app uses to search the information about zipcodes works only with brazilian zipcodes.


This application uses the [Aviso Brasil] (http://avisobrasil.com.br/correio-control/api-de-consulta-de-cep/) API to get the information of a zipcode and the Google Geocoding Service througt the wrapper [SVGeocoder](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVGeocoder) to get the geolocalization.

## Open-source

I've made it open-source to share with the people the way that I used Swift to make this application. 

*P.S: This is my first application written in Swift, and it was written when Swift had 5 months of life. I've learnt a lot after I wrote it and I hope to refactor this project to share with you a better way to write it with Swift soon.*

Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any improvement to sugest. If you have a feedback or wants to talk with me you can send me an e-mail: ofilipealvarenga [at] gmail.com :)
